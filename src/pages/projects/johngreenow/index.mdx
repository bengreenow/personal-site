# John Greenow's Personal Website

John Greenow is a Pastor and Emotional intelligence coach. He also happens to be my dad. So, knowing his son was a developer, naturally he approached me when he needed to make a website.

## Design

He needed a simple website, nothing too flashy, essentially an online buisness card. A place he could send prospective clients and a site he could use to grow his personal brand.

We discussed the design of the site in abstract terms, and my main takeaway for the art direction of the site was "Classy, Comfortable, Inviting".
I knew I wanted a dark theme, to me, a darker tone communicated luxury and elegance, so I decided to make the background black. As for the fonts, I chose a pairing of two san-serif fonts.

Work Sans was to be the main "Display" font - at a heavy weight and large this font is super inviting.
For my body copy font I went with a classic - Roboto. Strong, dependable and most importantly super readable at small sizes.

## Technologies

For building the site, I turned to the JS powered static site generator [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) for a few reasons.

### Simple

11ty, at it's core, just creates HTML files. Not to brag but - I know HTML. Even though it would be my first time using a SSG, knowing it was simply HTML with extra steps gave me a big confidence boost.

### SEO

It's an SSG! SEO is basically baked in! When making a SPA (which in this case is hilariously overkill) you'd have to worry about SEO by mixing and matching server side rendered stuff with your client side JS. Here, you don't. 
Google can crawl to it's hearts content. Helpful when John is trying to get his name out there.

### JavaScript

It runs on JS. I know JS. Simple as.

### Other Bits

For styling, if you know me, it's obvious I'm going with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). I've come to love it a lot. Doing breakpoints and hover states has never been easier.
Also, as we'll probably have a little bit of front end logic that CSS can't handle, I'm using [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/), another super simple bit of JS that makes my life a little easier.

## Hosting

Okay, I'll admit it. I'm a front end guy. If I can avoid backend as much as possible I will. So, I went with Netlify here.

Netlify is this amazing Deployment as a Service, where all you do is plug your Git repo up to it and you're up and running.
They also offer a super simple barebones CMS that links into the git repo seamlessly.

Different branches on your repo can correspond to different subdomains too, which I used to create a staging area to show my progress to John during development.

Overall I'd say it came out pretty well.
