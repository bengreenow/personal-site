# usb.places

This is a project I really enjoyed doing.
While not hugely technical, I still found myself challenged by decisions I had to make during the project.
This was a group project that I participated in during my 2nd year of University, where I was the delegated design lead.
This meant me, and my design team member, Joe, were to create a visual identity, mockups, and UI/UX for the product
"usb.places".

The app was to be a touring app for 1st year computer science students at Newcastle University.
The name is a play on the dot notation common in languages like Java and C++, hopefully conveying that the app would contain _places_ within the USB (Urban Sciences Building).
